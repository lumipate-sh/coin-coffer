# Coin Coffer

A simple personal finance and transaction record app

## status

The app is functional in its basic features.

Coin Coffer is a project created mostly to practice javascript development, in particular in its integrations with frontend in plain HTML/CSS and management of memory with the browser's local and session storage.
It is a project of the Upskill course and should be seen, first and foremost, as a training exercise, rather than an app for day to day use.
