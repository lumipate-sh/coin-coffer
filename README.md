## why make this?

Coin Coffer is a project created mostly to practice javascript development, in particular in its integrations with frontend in plain HTML/CSS and management of memory with the browser's local and session storage.
It is a project of the Upskill course and should be seen, first and foremost, as a training exercise, rather than an app for day to day use.

- segmentation of responsabilities
- JSON memory storage

### notes

a html/css layout has been provided to serve as a base from which to build upon.
i intend to personalize it to my own preference, however that will only happen after the core features have been implemented

### AI usage disclosure

some aspects of the development of this app were made with the use of generative artificial intelligente, namely in the generation of dummy data to test the app, the implementation of some functions and debugging and refactoring sections of code.
artificial inteligence, however, had no role in the design decicions of the app regarding features, functionality, features and overall development.
