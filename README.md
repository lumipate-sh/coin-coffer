# Coin Pouch

A simple personal finance &amp; transaction record app

## status

**PROJECT IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT**
As of now, the project has no active functionity. It is in its early stages of planning and ideation.

## why make this?

Coin Pouch is a project created mostly to practice javascript development, in particular in its integrations with frontend in plain HTML/CSS and management of memory with the browser's local and session storage.
It is a project of the Upskill course and should be seen, first and foremost, as a traning exercise, rather than an app for day to day use.

### notes

a html/css layout has been provided to serve as a base from which to build upon.
i intend to personalize it to my own preference, however that will only happen after the core features have been implemented
